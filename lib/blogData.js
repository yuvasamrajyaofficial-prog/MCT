    excerpt: "Can machines ever truly replicate human intuition, or will they always be bound by logic?",

      <h3>The Power of Logic</h3>
      <p>AI excels at logical reasoning and pattern recognition. It can process vast amounts of data far more efficiently than any human.</p>
      <h3>The Mystery of Intuition</h3>
      <p>Human intuition is often described as a "gut feeling" that transcends logical analysis. Replicating this in a machine remains one of the greatest challenges in AI development.</p>
